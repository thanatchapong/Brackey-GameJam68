## Operation Crumble

╓▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬╖

🎮 An 2D top‑down action RPG for Brackeys Game Jam 2025.2. 🎮

You are "Yuri Risuku", who is bothered by a biscuit brand because they reduce the sugar by 7%.  ＞﹏＜

You now embark on an adventure to destroy all of the biscuit factory for a revenge (or is it?).

╙▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬╜

## 🎯Goal

Survive as long as possible (or at least to level 50). Each time you clear a room by defeating all of the enemies, you can move on to the next room.

Each time you defeat an enemy, an experience orb will drop. Collect them until you can use your "Ultimate", and then you can select either a "Perk" or a "Risk". Though, don't think you can get away fine by not taking anything risky, as you will be forced to take a risky move eventually.
