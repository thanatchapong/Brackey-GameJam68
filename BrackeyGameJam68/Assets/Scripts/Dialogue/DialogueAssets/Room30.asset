  sentences:
  - Hey, Cheeso.
  - Hey, Yuri.
  - I want to tell you something.
  - "I feel like you deserve to know it\u2026"
  - What is it?
  - "The truth about why I\u2019m here\u2026"
  - "I\u2019ve never told you about my father, right?"
  - No?
  - My father was a DEA agent. He suspected that this place was a front for some
    kind of drug trafficking operation.
  - But nobody believed him, so he investigated this place by himself.
  - And he never returned.
  - "At least I wanted to prove that he was right. If it\u2019s the last thing I
    could do for him."
  - "I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t told you earlier."
  - ...
  - "So that\u2019s why\u2026"
  - "Don\u2019t worry Yuu. I understand."
  - Thank you, for telling me this.
  - 'Thank you, for understanding. '
  - I bet your father is waiting for you here.
  - Waiting for you to come and save him.
  - I hope so... I wanted to see him again.
