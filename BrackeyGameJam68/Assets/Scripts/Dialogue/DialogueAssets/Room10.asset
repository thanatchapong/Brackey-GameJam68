  sentences:
  - Hey, Cheeso.
  - Hey, Yuu.
  - What do you think will be in room 50?
  - I was gonna ask the same thing.
  - "Usually there\u2019ll be a vault where they store their money or some super
    secret recipes."
  - I hope it was a drug lab.
  - "A\u2026 What?"
  - A drug lab.
  - "Out of everything. Why? Don\u2019t tell me you want to try some."
  - No, but it would be so cool if we can uncover some kind of illegal operation.
  - We would be on all the news. All of my friends will be jealous of me.
  - Yeah, but first we would be arrested for trespassing.
  - You're no fun at all!
